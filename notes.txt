-------------------------------------
JAVASCRIPT

query toggle, close, open, modal

we will add an event listener to toggle,, when we click we will toggle the class show-nav at the body
(go to the css and add body.show-nav class.. and we want to show the nav when we toggle, so,,, transform: translateX(200px)=> width of the nav)
also add a transition 0.3s for transform at the body css

//Show modal or show the form (modal => id e modal-container) / open => id e sign up

we will add an event listener for open.. so when we click,, we are going to add a class to the modal container,, add class (show-modal)

// Hide modal
add a event listener to close,,, wwhen we click we are going to remove the class show-modal

{GO TO CSS AND style modal-container.show-modal class,, 
  display block / because we had it display none before. and it did not show up before we click
  
  we want to have a fade in effect so: we will have to go to .modal , and add an animation-name: modalopen;
  animation-duration --modal-duration,
  then we have to create a keyframe for the modalopen animation

  so it will go from opacity 0 to opacity 1 during the --modal-duration that we want, (1s)
  @keyframes modalopen {
    from {
      opacity: 0;
    }

    to {
      opacity: 1;
    }
  }
  }

  // HIDE MODAL ON OUTSIDE CLICK .. CHECK HOW.!
